{"name":"Kronk","body":"# Welcome\r\nIf you've worked with an HTTP service/API, you may have noticed how difficult it can be to troubleshoot data or performance issues. Kronk is a command line utility that gives you the tools to make this process much less painful. With Kronk, you easily parse and segregate data, run diffs between the parsed data from different queries, and easily replay logs and loadtest your HTTP applications. All parsed data is printed as expanded JSON, which makes it more readable and easy to compare. Here are a few examples of what it can do:\r\n\r\n### Display data formatted as JSON\r\n```\r\n$ kronk host.com/path.plist\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Diff response data from two queries\r\n```\r\n$ kronk host.com/path.xml host.com/path.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Parse from STDIN\r\n```\r\n$ curl host.com/path.json | kronk --parser json\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Replay GET logs against any host\r\n```\r\n$ cat access.log | grep GET | kronk stage-host.com --replay --qps 100\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Select specific data to display\r\n```\r\n# Return only name and text fields of an array of tweets.\r\n$ kronk host.com/path.json -- /tweets/*/name /tweets/*/text\r\n```\r\n\r\nKronk is capable of much more. Read more about it on the [WIKI](https://github.com/yaksnrainbows/kronk/wiki).\r\nThe latest stable Kronk release is also available from [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/gems/kronk).","tagline":"The swiss-army-knife of HTTP service tools.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
