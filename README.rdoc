= Kronk

* https://github.com/yaksnrainbows/kronk

== DESCRIPTION:

Kronk runs diffs against data from live and cached http responses.
Kronk was made possible by the sponsoring of AT&T Interactive.

== FEATURES:

* Parse and display or diff data from http response body and/or headers.

* Include or exclude specific data points with file-glob-like paths.

* Supports json, rails-ish xml, and plist.

* Support for custom data parsers and diff formatters.

* Launch IRB console with the retrieved response data.

* Support for proxies, ssl, and basic auth.

* Cookie/session handling.

* Easy-to-read output (color or ascii, line numbers, etc).

* URI-specific configuration.

* Helper methods for test suites.

* Auto-query reports with request randomization support.

* Yes, it works on Windows.

== SYNOPSIS:

Check if your json response returns the same data as your xml variety:

  $ kronk host.com/path.json host.com/path.xml

Compare body structure only (uses datatypes instead of values):

  $ kronk host.com/path.json host.com/path.xml --struct

Call comparison with similar uri suffixes:

  $ kronk host.com/path.json host.com/path.xml --suff '?page=1'

Compare response over ssl with the previous call:

  $ kronk https://host.com/path --prev

Compare response with a local file:

  $ kronk host.com/path.json ./saved_response.json

Do a simple text diff on the http response, including headers:

  $ kronk host.com/A/path.json host.com/B/path.json --raw -i

Run it to display formatted data:

  $ kronk host.com/path.json

Run it to display raw data with headers from the default host (localhost:3000).
Default host is assumed when the path starts with "/" and no local files match
the given path:

  $ kronk /path.json --raw -i

Parse the data and run an IRB console with the response:

  $ kronk http://host.com/path.json --irb

== CONFIGURATION:

Kronk pulls it's config from $HOME/.kronk and supports the following:

Set the file to save the last http response retrieved in:

  :cache_file: ~/.kronk_cache

Content types to match to a parser. Keys are used as a part of
a regexp and values are evaluated by const_get.

  :content_types:
    xml:   XMLParser
    plist: PlistParser
    json:  JSON

How to format the diff output. Supports the "special" values
:ascii_diff and :color_diff or any string that will correctly
resolve to a constant:

  :diff_format: :ascii_diff

Adding User-Agent aliases is useful and simple!

  :user_agents:
    win_ie9: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.0)

Disabling cookies altogether may be done as so:

  :use_cookies: false

Setting URI-specific config options - useful if you always need to send
headers or use one-off configs. Each URI option key is dropped in a regexp
to match against the given URIs so this also works for local files.
See Kronk::Request.retrieve and Kronk::Response#selective_data
for all options supported:

  :uri_options:
    example.com:
      :parser:      XMLParser
      :http_method: POST

      :follow_redirects: true

      :ignore_data:
        - path/to/data/point

      :headers:
        X-Something: custom header value

      :query:
        offset: 1
        limit:  10

Require specific files or gems in the ruby runtime:

  :requires:
    - kronk-my_custom_parser
    - kronk-my_custom_diff_formatter

Show line numbers in the output:

  :show_lines: true

Assign a default host to use when none is specified:

  :default_host: http://localhost:3000

=== Bash Completion:

Bash completion is available by sourcing the file returned by:

  $ kronk --completion
  [gem path]/script/kronk_completion

== DATA TRAVERSING:

One of Kronk's most powerful features is its ability to segregate data.
From the command line, this is done by passing data paths after '--':

  $ kronk http://host.com -- data/path1 data/path2/1/child

The previous example will narrow down the parsed data returned to
something like:

  {
    "data" => {
      "path1" => "value1",
      "path2" => [
        nil,
        {
          "child" => "child value"
        },
        nil,
        nil
      ]
    }
  }

If excluding data points is preferred, prepending a '-' to the path will
flag it to remove data:

  $ kronk http://host.com -- -data/path2

  {
    "data" => {
      "path1" => "value1",
      "path3" => "value3",
      "path4" => "value4"
    }
  }

If you would like to exclude or include only items with a specific child
attribute, you can do so by appending "/.." to the path.

  $ kronk http://host.com -- data/path2/1/child/..

  {
    "data" => {
      "path2" => [
        nil,
        {
          "first_child" => "first value",
          "child" => "child value",
          "last_child" => "last value"
        },
        nil,
        nil
      ]
    }
  }

There are additionally a variety of wildcard and special characters that
are supported:

* \* matches /.*/, meaning zero or more characters

* \*\*/ matches any key recursively down the data structure

* ../ matches the parent of the previously matched item

* 2..5, 2...6 and 2,3 match any Integer or String from 2 to 5

* ? matches zero or one character

* | effectively works as an "OR" character, matches /^val1|val2$/

* \= is used to match values and may be used in conjuction with a key or not

* Parentheses may be used in conjunction with other special characters
  for a given path item, such as: /path(1|2)

* \\ escapes any special path character

Check out Kronk::Path and Kronk::DataSet for more details on data traversing.

Note: Bash may try to parse your data paths, especially if they start with
wildcards or if they contain the pipe "|" character, so you may need to put
single quotes around some of your paths.
